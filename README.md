## Knights Travails

This project solves the Knights Travails problem from The Odin Project JavaScript curriculum.

It finds the shortest path a chess knight can take from one square to another on an 8x8 board, using valid knight moves and breadth-first search (BFS).

### Usage

Run with Node.js:

```bash
node knight-travails.js
```

Edit the last line of `knight-travails.js` to change start/end positions.

### Example Output

```
=> You made it in 3 moves!  Here's your path:
	[3,3]
	[5,4]
	[7,5]
	[6,4]
```
